# Introduction to open source

Open source software is code that anyone can view, use, modify, and share. This tutorial explains what open source means and why your first contribution matters.

## What makes software "open source"?

Open source isn't just about free access to code. It's a philosophy built on four freedoms:

1. **View** - Anyone can read the source code
2. **Use** - Anyone can run the software for any purpose
3. **Modify** - Anyone can change the code to suit their needs
4. **Share** - Anyone can distribute copies, including modifications

The LICENSE file in a repository defines exactly what's permitted. Cattlelog uses the MIT License, one of the most permissive open source licenses.

## Why open source matters

### For software

- **Quality through transparency** - More eyes on code means more bugs found
- **Innovation through collaboration** - Ideas build on other ideas
- **Longevity through community** - Projects outlive any single maintainer

### For you

- **Learn from real code** - See how experienced developers solve problems
- **Build your portfolio** - Contributions are public and verifiable
- **Join a community** - Connect with developers worldwide
- **Give back** - Improve tools you use every day

## Software you already use

Many tools you rely on are open source:

| Project | What it is              | Contributors |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| VS Code | Your code editor        | 2,000+       |
| Node.js | JavaScript runtime      | 3,000+       |
| React   | UI library              | 1,500+       |
| Git     | Version control         | 1,500+       |
| Linux   | Operating system kernel | 20,000+      |

Every one of these started with someone's first contribution.

## The social contract

Open source projects aren't just code. They're communities with shared expectations. Most projects include these files:

### LICENSE

Defines legal permissions. Without a license, code is "all rights reserved" by default. The license tells you what you can and can't do.

### CODE_OF_CONDUCT

Sets behavior expectations. Most projects adopt the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), which establishes a welcoming, harassment-free environment.

### CONTRIBUTING

Explains how to participate. This might include:

- How to report bugs
- How to suggest features
- Code style requirements
- The pull request process

These files create a foundation of trust. Contributors know the rules. Maintainers know what to expect.

## How contributions work

The fork workflow keeps everyone's work separate until it's reviewed:

```text
1. FORK      Copy the project to your account
      ↓
2. CLONE     Download your copy locally
      ↓
3. BRANCH    Create a workspace for your changes
      ↓
4. CHANGE    Make your edits
      ↓
5. COMMIT    Save your work
      ↓
6. PUSH      Upload to your fork
      ↓
7. PR        Propose changes to the original
      ↓
8. REVIEW    Maintainer evaluates your work
      ↓
9. MERGE     Changes become part of the project
```

This workflow protects the main project while welcoming contributions. Your changes don't affect anyone else until they're reviewed and approved.

See [Fork workflow](../guides/fork-workflow.md) for step-by-step instructions.

## Your first contribution

This assignment is your first open source contribution. That's a milestone worth recognizing.

When your pull request is merged:

- Your code becomes part of a public project
- Your name appears in the git history forever
- You can legitimately say you've contributed to open source

It might feel small - just one ASCII creature. But every contributor to VS Code, Node.js, and React started somewhere. Many started with documentation fixes, typo corrections, or small additions exactly like this.

---

## Beyond this class

Once you've contributed to one project, you can contribute to any. Here's how to find opportunities:

### Good first issues

Many projects label beginner-friendly tasks:

- `good first issue`
- `beginner friendly`
- `help wanted`
- `easy`

GitHub's search: `is:open is:issue label:"good first issue"`

### Start with what you use

The best contributions come from users who notice problems:

- Found a typo in documentation? Fix it.
- Confused by unclear instructions? Improve them.
- Hit a bug? Report it (or fix it).

### Hacktoberfest

Every October, [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) encourages open source contributions. Complete four pull requests and earn recognition (and sometimes swag).

---

## Common concerns

### "I'm not good enough"

Most contributions aren't groundbreaking features. Documentation improvements, bug reports, and small fixes are valuable. Projects need contributors at all skill levels.

### "What if I make a mistake?"

That's what code review is for. Maintainers will guide you. A rejected PR isn't failure - it's feedback.

### "I don't know where to start"

Start here. You're already doing it.
